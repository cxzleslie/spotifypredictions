# Spotify Analysis

## Overview
A project which attempts to analyse the main features of a song (acousticness, loudness, energy) and cluster them into groups. Through clustering, recommendations for future songs can be made simpler by adjusting the main parameters of the song. K-means clustering and some simple machine learning was attempted, however the results were subpar.
